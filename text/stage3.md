Let's head to the final stage of your assessment! ü•≥

*Level 3:*
*AMRE*
Time to get out of your own comfort zone. This process is for you to reach out to people around you, get their opinions and thoughts on advisors and what their ideal advisor should be. This will also build your resistance against rejections (if you get any).

Fill up your database first, from your contacts, listing them down does not mean you will be reaching out to them, this exercise simply gives you a more macro view of your battleground, which will come in handy for the other Levels ahead.

Make a COPY and complete 15 AMRE before you can progress to the next Level. 
Send them to this chat in a zip file once you‚Äôre done.

Highly focused and disciplined advisors will only need: 10 days to complete this. But of course should you need a time extension, do let us know! 

Looking forward to your AMRE by *<insert date> 2359H* üòä

This is the final level for Phase 0, you can do it! All the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
