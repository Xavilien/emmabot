Alright lets go to level 2!! ðŸ¥³

*Level 2*
Basics of Financial Planning
Enjoy watching all the videos to have a bird's eye view on what financial planning is all about, so that you understand the value advisors provide for our clients, and have an idea on how you can provide this value for your friends as well. 

Once you are done, send in your thoughts and reflections to this chat in a word doc. 

Highly focused and disciplined advisors will only need: 3 Days to complete this. But of course should you need a time extension, do let us know! 

Would love to hear your thoughts and reflections by *<insert date> 2359H*. All the best ðŸ˜Š
